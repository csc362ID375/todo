While digital technology is an extremely useful tool, the time in which we must spend staring at our screens during this pandemic can be concerning. From zoom classes, to calling friends, to even ordering food, I have to use the internet. Knowing that I wouldnâ€™t be able to simply make a substitute for our screen in this class, I wanted to instead build an application that improves productivity for anyone on the internet, hopefully allowing us more manageable time on our devices.

A to do list is a simple but powerful tool for anyone who has trouble focusing on their work. This application keeps all the things you need to get done in an easy to acess chrome extension. The popup window lets you add taks before breaking up those bigger assignments into subtasks. Each task and subtask can be edited and deleted at ease and bigger tasks can be crossed off for a feeling of accomplishment. 

Laslty, this to do list is accompanied by a timer. The well known Pomodoro method suggests people break up their work into 15 minute increments when takss are hard to get done. Not too short, not too long, anyone can focus and accomplish something for 15 minutes at a time. 

Overall, this extension utilizes data inputted by the user to help organize their life a little bit better.
