While digital technology is an extremely useful tool, the time in which we must spend staring at our screens during this pandemic can be concerning. From zoom classes, to calling friends, to even ordering food, we have to use the internet. Knowing that I wouldnâ€™t be able to simply make a substitute for our screen in this class, I wanted to instead build an application that improves productivity for anyone on the internet, hopefully allowing us more manageable time on our devices. Overall, this extension utilizes data inputted by the user to help organize their life a little bit better.

Upon opening the extension, the user has two main features at their disposal. 

1. A To Do List: 
    To add a new task, the user can simply type it into the main input box with the waiting prompt "New Task..." and click the attached "Add" button. 

    To edit an already added task, the user can click on the writing they wish to edit directly. This will make the text editable. Typing in these boxes autosaves changes, which the user will be altered of at the top of the popup. 

    To cross off a task, the user can check the check button. Clicking this button again will uncross off the task.

    To add a subtask to a main task, the plus button can be clicked. A subtask will appear with the prompt "Edit Me". Subtasks can be edited the same as main tasks. 

    Deleting a task or a subtask can be achieved by clicking the x button. Note: subtasks can only be deleted and not crossed off or further subtasked.

2. A Timer: 
    To start the timer, the user can press the play button. To restart the timer, the user can press the stop button. The timer will automatically restart after the timer runs out. 

    Note: The time can not be adjusted to adhere to the Pomodoro Method. The timer can also not be paused as needing to step away from such a small time interval means you should probably just start over the interval when you can. 
    
    The color of the timer corresponds to how much time is left: the timer turning red when there is a fourth of the time left, yellow when there is between a fourth and a half of the time left, and green when less than half the time has passed.

    When the user closes the popup the timer will continue to run in the background. If the timer runs out when the popup is closed, the icon for the extension will turn red until the popup is next used.
